### 1. **Prompt Design - Best Practices**
- **Summary:** This notebook provides best practices for designing prompts for generative AI models. It includes a detailed walkthrough of techniques to maximize the model's response quality. Since the original notebook uses the PaLM model, an updated version that utilizes the Gemini model is available [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/intro_prompt_design.ipynb).

### 2. **Chain of Thought & ReAct**
- **Summary:** The notebook introduces the "Chain of Thought" and "ReAct" (Reasoning and Acting) frameworks for working with generative models. These frameworks enhance the quality of generated responses by encouraging multi-step reasoning. An updated version of this notebook using the latest Gemini model is available [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/chain_of_thought_react.ipynb).

### 3. **Ideation with Generative Models on Vertex AI**
- **Summary:** This notebook demonstrates how to use generative models for ideation tasks, such as brainstorming and content generation. It provides hands-on exercises to explore creative applications of AI models. An updated version using the Gemini model is available [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/ideation.ipynb).

### 4. **Question Answering with Generative Models on Vertex AI**
- **Summary:** This notebook focuses on using generative models to develop question-answering systems. It includes step-by-step instructions on building a model that can understand and respond accurately to user queries. The updated version can be accessed [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/question_answering.ipynb).

### 5. **Text Classification with Generative Models on Vertex AI**
- **Summary:** Explore how generative models can be used for text classification tasks, including categorizing content based on sentiment, topic, and other characteristics. An updated notebook version using the Gemini model is accessible [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/text_classification.ipynb).

### 6. **Text Extraction with Generative Models on Vertex AI**
- **Summary:** This notebook illustrates how to use generative models for extracting information from text. The techniques covered can be applied to use cases like extracting keywords, entities, or summaries from larger bodies of text. The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/text_extraction.ipynb).

### 7. **Text Summarization with Generative Models on Vertex AI**
- **Summary:** This notebook demonstrates text summarization using generative models, showcasing how to condense large volumes of information into more digestible summaries. The updated version of this notebook is available [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/prompts/examples/text_summarization.ipynb).
